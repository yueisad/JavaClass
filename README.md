# JavaClass

This is collection of simple java projects and exercises. To view each of the projects, look for the src folder within each project folder. The src will contain the main java files. 
In order to run the java files on VScode, you will need to install the java extensions. Download the entire project folder to correctly run the java files on VScode, which contains the necessary launch.json file.
